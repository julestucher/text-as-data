# Text as Data: Research Blog

This blog will track progress and exploration of a research project for DACSS 756: Text as Data.

1. A brief introduction of yourself and your interests.

Hi everyone, my name is Jules Tucher (they/them), and I'm a second semester DACSS student and Data Analyst at Veritas Prep Charter School in Springfield, MA. Last semester, I enjoyed working on a data engineering projects about MA state election results on Question 2, which eliminates the MCAS graduation requirement for high school students, and a 602 reserach experiment about how factual information about gender-affirming healthcare for transgender minors impacts support for puberty blockers. I also wrote two research proposals, one for a research project looking at the association between exercise behaviors, gender-affirming care, and gender dysphoria among transmasculine individuals and an evaluation proposal for the Veritas Prep Early College gateway examination process. These projects represent my interest in K-12 education, Massachusetts policy issues, LGBT representation, and the experiences of transgender people.

2. A clear description of your research question.

I am curious about how queer people use alternative online social media platforms to build community in Western Mass. I am also curious what themes are most commonly posted about on the queer-only text-based platform Lex. What types of posts get the most interaction? How do users present themselves in their profiles? Since this app is relatively new (launched in 2019) and does not have a web version or public API, there is no precedent for computational social science methods applied to its data.

3. A clear description of your corpus and where you plan to access it.

The corpus will include posts and user profiles from a 100 mile radius of Amherst, MA over the past 3 months. Since there is not a web-version, I will use the software Fiddler Everywhere and an internet proxy to intercept API calls from the app on my mobile device. I will reverse-engineer API calls to pull JSON files in Python.

4. A rationale for the corpus that identifies why it is appropriate for addressing the selected research question.

This corpus provides an insight into how queer and LGBT people are self-identifying, self-disclosing, and being themselves online in their own words. 

Optionally, students may also include preliminary summary statistics on the corpus.
